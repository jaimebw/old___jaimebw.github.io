Hey there 👋🏻,

I'm Jaime Bowen Varela. Glad you made it here. 
I have a lot of experience in different fields regarding aviation software, data science, CFD, Machine Learning, etc...

- I'm currently based in San Francisco, CA, USA 📍.
- Currently pursuing my Ph.D. 🎓 at [Carlos III University of Madrid](https://phd-aerospace.uc3m.es/portfolio/jaime-bowen-varela/), trying to crack how to use FPGAs (in a hardware-in-the-loop setup) to actively control flows in aero, bringing cutting-edge control techniques closer to real-time flight applications.
- I'm working at Wisk Aero✈️ as an embedded software engineer.
- If you are looking for consulting or want to ask me any questions, hit me up on LinkedIn or in X.
- My favorite plane is the [Stuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87)
- I'm passionate about computers 💻, obsessed with anything that flies ✈️, live for the thrill of motorcycles 🏍️, and get lost in the pages of vintage books 📚.
